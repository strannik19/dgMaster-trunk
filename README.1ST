This is an updated version of the dgmaster application (http://dgmaster.sourceforge.net/)
Implemented a structured approach based on a pipeline that enables the user to configure the generation of multiple files, that could potentially depend on each other. 

Example of usage: 
Generate files corresponding to users, their bank accounts and transactions on those bank accounts. 

In order to run dgMaster:
java -jar dist/dgMaster.jar


Use Java 6 to compile and run.
